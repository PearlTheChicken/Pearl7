# Pearl7 -- The replacement for the outdated Pearl Browser 17.2 for Windows 7 by win2kuser

## Why Pearl7?
Pearl7 was made to replace the oudated build by win2kuser (Pearl 17.2). This build is coming soon and should get more frequent updates, it runs under Pearl 24.0 as of now!


## Fun Facts

* Pearl 17.2 didn't even have tabbed browsing! That didn't come until Pearl 18.0-pre8
* Pearl 17.2 was the one of the very last to be compatible with themes! It was removed in Pearl 19.2 and fully deprecated in Pearl 24.0.
* The theme files actually stayed until build 22.0 but they served no purpose (unless you hacked the version to run the themes bc the ApplyTheme function existed)
* The ApplyTheme function and the Theme Engine which handled themes stayed until Pearl 24.0 but it had no UI to control and load themes.
* Themes were removed in Pearl 19.2 but remained in the code until Pearl 24.0
* Pearl 27 might move to .NET 8, sadly making it harder for modders to backport it to Windows 7.
* There were many hidden unused bits of code that were cleaned up and remvoed in Pearl 24
